# ChatAppleNotes

A simple application to parse your local Apple Notes and chat with them using Ollama.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```
## Usage
```bash
chat-notes
```
## TODO

1. Integrate with llama-index to index all of the notes 
2. Chat in RAG mode 
3. Possible idea: insert as much similar Notes as possible in context to get high recall 
4. Add OpenAI chat
